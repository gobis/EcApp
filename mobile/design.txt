===========
AP Mode :
  Phone can directly connect to device

Station mode:
  Phone can connect to device via router


Design:
   Splash Screen:
      initial screen where will ask for the permission

   WiFiActivity
      shows the wifi apart from the device
      mFromEditPage => you can reach this screen from splash screen or DeviceEditScreen
        -- it is about moving AP mode to station mode

   DeviceListActivity
      shows the device list apart from wifi

   AssociatedWifiHelper :
      class used to sniff the network

      step1 : create instance of the class
      step 2 : startSniffingNetwork()
         there are two callbacks
            sniffStarted();
            sniffCompleted();  // this results mac with IP address

       hack : network sniff parallelism is set as 5 (ie using  5 threads to find out reachable IP )
       sniffing completion is done only when ip reaches 252 and above
       NOTE: have to find some way to address this issue


   DeviceControlListActivity
      page actually has the device, and can control it

      showStationModeDialog : fn to move it to station mode
      IMP: only page where you can set it to station mode
      this will post the Router info to the Gateway

      you has to click on the scan device , to scan the device


    Storage point :
        in case, you are adding four channel device (ie 1 device with 4 relays)
        there will be 4 records gets created with info...
        in case, you want to update any device level info, then all the four rows needs to be updated


   DeviceEditActivity
      page user can edit it

   QrCodeScanActivity
      qr code scan page where user can scan the qr code for password
